# IronDAO Pitch Deck

## IronDAO
**The Proof Engine for Capital Execution in the Real World**  
From mining to government infrastructure, we help capital flow where it delivers results - with zero corruption.

---

## The Problem
Billions in infrastructure, development, and industrial spending are lost each year due to:  
- Corruption and embezzlement  
- Delayed payments and mismanagement  
- No way to provably verify real-world work  
- Lack of accountability at scale  

**Capital exists. Trust does not.**

---

## The Solution: IronDAO
A blockchain-powered Proof System + Capital Execution Protocol that:  
- Tracks milestones  
- Verifies physical work using sensor + drone + oracle data  
- Pays contributors automatically when work is verified  
- Works with any capital source: DAO, government, NGO, VC, treasury

---

## Who It's For
IronDAO works anywhere real-world capital meets human action:  
- Mining & Refinement  
- Government Infrastructure  
- Agriculture  
- Energy Projects  
- Construction  
- Disaster Relief

---

## How It Works
1. Capital is locked in a smart contract or escrow  
2. Work is divided into milestones  
3. Each milestone requires:  
   - Sensor proof (GPS, weight, output)  
   - Visual proof (video, drone)  
   - Oracle validation  
   - Human or automated audit  
4. When 3+ sources confirm, payment is released automatically

---

## IronDAO Proof Stack
IronDAO’s core IP is the multi-layer proof system for physical execution:  
- Sensors: GPS, volume, activity  
- Video: Drone or IP camera (hashed)  
- Oracles: Weather, logistics, satellite  
- Audits: DAO agents or trusted 3rd party  
- Reputation: On-chain worker/vendor history

---

## Not Just a DAO: A Proof Company
IronDAO is a hardware + software infrastructure company:  
- Modular Proof Kits (drones, GPS units, IoT)  
- Proof-as-a-Service for governments, DAOs, ESG funds, developers

---

## Business Model
- Protocol Revenue: % of milestone payout  
- Proof Kit Sales  
- Integration Fees  
- Token Economy: governance, access rights, reputation

---

## Vision
In 5 years, IronDAO becomes the Stripe + Chainlink for capital deployment.  
Wherever a factory is funded, a solar farm built, or a road constructed - IronDAO ensures it really happened, and the right people were paid.
